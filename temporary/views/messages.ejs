            The Young Innovators' Program of IIT Kharagpur, in its eight years
            of existence has been able to establish itself as a flagship event
            of this country for high school children. The event is a showcase of
            the enormous talent that the children of this country have in terms
            of their ability to think beyond classroom lessons and come up with
            innovative ideas to some relevant and pertinent problems. The
            projects and exhibits belie the age of these young minds. The desire
            to push the boundaries of their imagination and the urge to do
            something useful and relevant to society have left us mesmerized. I
            wish this event keeps growing as the years go by and spread its
            wings across the country and beyond.

             Albert Einstein once said that "The true sign of intelligence is not
            knowledge but imagination". One can go on learning facts and figures
            but unless one uses one's imagination to see how these facts and
            figures add up to make the bigger picture one can never claim to
            have learnt anything. In fact we have to look beyond the classroom
            and try to use the knowledge that we have learnt to bring a
            difference in our lives. I am very happy to note that the Young
            innovators programme of IIT Kharagpur is encouraging this habit of
            critical thinking among school children. Imagination comes naturally
            to children whose minds are often unfettered by the realities that
            adults have to deal with. YIP helps them to power their imagination
            to make changes in their own lives and those of others around them.
            Children are thus encouraged to think about the larger society and
            be more engaged creatures. This engagement is bound to make them
            more conscientious learners. As they grow up, they will reap the
            benefits of this learning by being better human beings and better
            citizens.

             Our history in this planet is a story of innovations and inventions.
            Our story on this planet is about facing new challenges, devising
            new solutions and moving on to the next challenge. On the whole,
            these innovations have brought enormous benefits to humankind, but
            sometimes they have also brought unintended consequences. Today's
            greatest challenges are the threats to the environment and human
            well-being. I am sure that we will find our way out of these as
            well. The Young Innovators' Program of IIT Kharagpur is our way to
            spur this consciousness among the youngsters who are our future.
